# ðŸ©º Medical Image to Text Report Generation

This project builds a deep learning model to automatically generate medical textual descriptions from chest X-ray images, such as identifying diagnoses and modality. It follows an encoder-decoder architecture, combining a CNN-based image encoder with a Transformer-based text decoder.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Given a chest X-ray image, the model aims to generate a clinical-style textual report describing the condition shown in the image.

**Example Input**: A chest X-ray image  
**Example Output**: *Frontal chest X-ray showing cardiomegaly with pulmonary edema.*

```bash
Final_X-ray-medical.ipynb       # Main notebook for training & inference
images/                         # Chest X-ray input images
captions.csv                    # Report captions per image
model/                          # Saved model checkpoints
utils.py                        # Image preprocessing and data utilities

## ðŸ§  Methodology

The notebook performs the following steps:

1. **Dataset Preparation**
   - Uses the [Indiana University Chest X-ray Collection (IU X-Ray)](https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/faq) dataset.
   - Includes X-ray image files and corresponding textual reports.

2. **Preprocessing**
   - Resize and normalize grayscale images.
   - Tokenize medical reports for training the decoder.

3. **Model Design**
   - Encoder: CNN (e.g., ResNet or CLIP-based feature extractor).
   - Decoder: Transformer or LSTM-based architecture for sequence generation.

4. **Training**
   - Uses cross-entropy loss between generated and reference reports.
   - Implements teacher forcing during training.

5. **Evaluation**
   - BLEU score for quality of generated captions.
   - Visual inspection of image + predicted report pairs.
